### How to setup vcpkg (in manifest mode)

Call CMake with `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`

Add optional features by listing them with `-DVCPKG_MANIFEST_FEATURES=feature1;feature2`

See [vcpkg.json](vcpkg.json) for available features.

Note, however, that under MinGW you'll need to specify the vcpkg triplet:
```shell
-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-mingw-[static|dynamic]  # choose either `static` or `dynamic`.
-DVCPKG_HOST_TRIPLET=x64-mingw-[static|dynamic]    # <-- needed only if MSVC cannot be found. 
```
